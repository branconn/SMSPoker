### SMS Poker
The idea is straightforward: an application that facilitates a text-based poker game with friends. No need for players to install any software. User input is received through sms and game events are sent through it as well.

Execution will be a bit more difficult, but the nature of the problem allows it to be subdivided cleanly. I expect the majority of the energy will be spent finding the right free/cheap services to 1) send/receive sms 2) host the application. I am planning on using pythonAnywhere for the latter, but as I type this I'm considering stopping short of that and just running it local when I want to play. Simpler and more secure, but not as useful as a demo of skill.
